## Introduction

Probability is a foundational concept in statistics, and understanding the basics of probability is important for understanding the theory behind commonly used statistical tests and developing statistical methods. Here, we discuss 

##Random Variables

Random variables are variables that can take on a set of possible numerical outcomes, each of which has a probability of occuring. For example, the result of a coin flip can be thought of as a random variable that can take on one of two values: heads or tails, each with a probability $\frac{1}{2}$ of occuring.
